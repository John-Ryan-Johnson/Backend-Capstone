# Super's Choice

## Description
Super's Choice was created as an internal company application for employee management. It is a full-stack application built using React for the front-end and C# for the back-end. It also uses ASP.NET Core, SQL database and HTTP-based APIs. Firebase was also used for authentication. Super's Choice allows an employee to register upon hiring and then have the ability to log in and see their particular work history or work schedule. When an employee clicks on the schedule icon and the employee is on the schedule, then the user is able to see the run form for that individual machine and begin working. Throughout the run the employee can choose an option for any downtime that may occur and make notes about the downtime. Once the run is finished the user can save the form to the database and then move on to the next machine. The supervisor has more privileges than a regular employee, as they should. When the supervisor is logged in they can choose employees or machines icons. When the supervisor chooses employees the user is taken to see all employees and has the ability to see that individual employee's schedule or history. If the supervisor chooses the machines icon the user will be taken to see all machines. This is where the supervisor can add an employee to a machine in order to populate the schedule for that employee.
